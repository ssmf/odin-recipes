    <p>This homemade cherry pie is perfectly sliceable with a thick almond-hinted
     cherry pie filling and a golden brown buttery flaky pie crust.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Homemade Pie Crust</li>
        <li>4 and 1/2 cups halved & quartered pitted fresh cherries</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (135g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (28g) cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (15ml) lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (14g) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon (15ml) milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The crust: Prepare either pie crust recipe through step 5.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: In a large bowl, stir the cherries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, vanilla, and almond extract together until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough.</li>
        <li>Pour the few Tablespoons of leftover juice into a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir for 3-4 minutes or until juice has slightly reduced and thickened.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400째F (204째C).</li>
        <li>Arrange the lattice: Remove the other disc of chilled pie dough from the refrigerator. Roll the dough into a circle that is 12 inches diameter.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush the top of the pie crust with the egg wash. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar, if using.</li>
        <li>Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Keeping the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down to 375째F (190째C) and bake for an additional 30-40 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove pie from the oven, place on a cooling rack, and cool for at least 3-4 hours before slicing and serving. Filling will be too juicy if the pie is warm when you slice it.</li>
        <li>Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
